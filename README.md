Realm Rhapsody is a C# console-based game focused on increasing your strength by defeating bosses.

If you desire, you can jump straight to the final boss, but otherwise you can beat the easier bosses beforehand, therefore increasing your strength/damage.

You are given a starting weapon based on your given backstory.
